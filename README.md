# cifar10-using-CNN

->it is a small image classification using CIFAR10 dataset in tensorflow ,first used convolutional neural network for image classification of this problem .
->first trained this dataset using Artificial neural network to check how performance looks like and then trained it using convolutional neural network and see how model accuracy works.
